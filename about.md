Hi, my name is Arhum Zafar and I am a recent UW-Madison graduate. I currently work in field of Machine Learning, in the Milwaukee Area. My career interests surround Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Science, and their applications to all sorts of problems. I am also interested in pursuing graduate-level opportunities in the Statistics or ML/DS field.
